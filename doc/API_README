We use to check the doxygen documentation in as part of the source tree,
but this was just too many files and was overwhelming subversion. So now
you need to build your own copy.

We have rules in the makefile to build doxygen documentation if doxygen is
on your system. Do "make doxygen-run". 

If you are on the JPL computers, there is a version of this already built
and available at /groups/algorithm/level2_fp_doxygen/html/index.html.
