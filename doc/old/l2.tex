\section{Introduction}

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory Mission (OCO) will make the first
time-dependent, global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with
the precision and resolution needed to characterize its sources and
sinks. These measurements will improve humankind's understanding of
the processes that regulate atmospheric \COtwo\ and enable more
reliable forecasts of climate change.

The OCO instrument consists of three boresighted high resolution
grating spectrometers.  Each of these spectrometers measures the
intensity of radiation over one of three very narrow Near Infrared
(NIR) bands that are sensitive to the presence of \COtwo\ and \Otwo.

The L2 Algorithm software takes spectra measured by the OCO instrument
and derives the column integrated \COtwo\ volume mixing ratio
(\XCOtwo).  The L2 Algorithm software is also capable of retrieving
\XCOtwo\ from observations by the ground based Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (FTS) network as well as from observations made by the
SCIAMACHY instrument, currently in orbit aboard the ENVISAT satellite.

The code is written in Fortran 90 and runs on the OCO Linux cluster.
It has also been run on the JPL institutional supercomputing cluster
(cosmos), the JPL High Performance Computing group's Los Angeles
cluster, and on the atmospheric science machines at Colorado State
University.

\section{Getting the code}

The code and supporting files can be obtained from the subversion
repository on nephthys.  You must have an account on nephthys and be
listed in the subversion users directory.  If you are not in the users
directory, please contact Jennifer Kesterson at JPL
(\texttt{Jennifer.A.Kesterson@jpl.nasa.gov}, 818-393-2568).

The simplest thing to do is to use the same directory structure which
exists in the subversion repository:

\begin{verbatim}
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/alg/L2_Contrib/
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/alg/L2_EXE/
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/alg/L2_Support/
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/alg/L2_Tests/
\end{verbatim}

To check out the latest code:

\begin{verbatim}
  cd ${HOME}/alg/L2_EXE/
  svn checkout ${SVNROOT}/L2_EXE/trunk
\end{verbatim}

This will create an \texttt{trunk} directory containing the latest
code.  The value of \texttt{\${SVNROOT}} depends on whether you are
accessing the repository from JPL (\texttt{export
SVNROOT=https://svn/oco/alg/}) or from outside using SSH tunneling
(\texttt{export SVNROOT=https://localhost:20443/oco/alg/}).  See
Appendix A for instructions to set up SSH tunneling.

To update your copy of the code, simply enter the \texttt{trunk} directory
and use the command:

\begin{verbatim}
  svn update
\end{verbatim}

\section{Building the code}

Enter the \texttt{trunk/src} directory and type \texttt{make} for some
brief instructions:

\begin{verbatim}
  To build the L2 PGE:
        make oco_l2

  The default compiler is g95.  This can be overridden by using FC= on the command line.
  Valid compilers are: 
        f90 (Absoft)
        g95 (GNU)
				ifort (Intel)
        f95 (NAG)

  Valid options are:
        BITS=(32/64)   (default 64)
        FTS=(t/f)      (default t)
        DEBUG=(t/f)    (default f)
        PARALLEL=(t/f) (default f)
        OPT=(t/f)      (default f)
        HDF=(t/f)      (default f)

  For example:
        make oco_l2 FC=f90 PARALLEL=t DEBUG=t

\end{verbatim}

Some compilers (like NAG) choke on some of the FTS code, so use the
\texttt{FTS=f} option if you run into this issue.  Of course, the
resulting executable will not be able to do FTS retrievals. HDF will download
and compile the HDF5 libraries using the compiler you specify, but may not
work with all compilers. Note that you will need to delete the .depend file and
run `make clean` when switching between the HDF to non-HDF version.

The makefile will create a binary with a name like
\texttt{oco\_l2.g95-1930}, which tells us the compiler used and revision
number in the subversion repository.

\section{Running the code}

A number of testcases are stored under subversion in
\texttt{\${SVNROOT}/L2\_Tests}.

\begin{verbatim}
  cd ${HOME}/alg/L2_Tests
  svn co ${SVNROOT}/L2_Tests/trunk
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{A Nadir Case}

\subsubsection{Generating a simulated spectrum}

There are a number of nadir test cases in \texttt{test\_nadir}.  Let's
generate a simulated OCO spectrum for Park Falls, Wisconsin, in July,
with an aerosol optical depth of 0.1.

\begin{verbatim}
  cd ${HOME}/alg/L2_Tests/trunk/test_nadir/pf_Jul1_TROP_01/FM
  rsync -a std_input/ oco_l2.g95-1930
\end{verbatim} %$

This will copy the contents of \texttt{std\_input} into a directory
called \texttt{oco\_l2.g95-1930}.  Enter this directory and look at
its contents.

\begin{verbatim}
drwxr-xr-x  5 hnair algorithm 4096 Apr 25 15:33 in/
-rw-r--r--  1 hnair algorithm 6060 Mar 27 15:47 oco_l2.inp
-rw-r--r--  1 hnair algorithm 3189 Mar 27 15:47 oco_l2.run
lrwxrwxrwx  1 hnair algorithm   40 May  1 09:08 oco_l2.win -> ../../../static_fts_locations/oco_l2.win
drwxr-xr-x  4 hnair algorithm 4096 Apr 25 15:33 out/
\end{verbatim}

The majority of input files are located in the \texttt{in} directory.
The \texttt{out} directory stores the run output.  

On startup, the code looks for a file in the current directory called
\texttt{oco\_l2.run}.  This file contains run parameters that should be
sounding independent.  The idea is that the user would only need to
update \texttt{oco\_l2.inp} and the appropriate files in the \texttt{in}
subdirectory for different test cases.

You can run the code in this directory:

\begin{verbatim}
  ${HOME}/alg/L2_EXE/trunk/bin/oco_l2.g95-1930 > stdout 2> stderr
\end{verbatim} %$

This particular case takes about 6 minutes to run on coral.  Upon
completion, you will have \texttt{oco\_l2.log}, \texttt{stderr}, and
\texttt{stdout} files which contain a lot of diagnostic output.

The generated spectrum is \texttt{in/l1b/spec/OCO/OCO\_1\_00001.0001}.  Even
though it's an output file in this case, it is an input file for the
retrieval, so that's why it's in the \texttt{in} directory.

\subsubsection{Performing a retrieval}

We can now use the spectrum we just generated to perform a retrieval.
Edit the \texttt{oco\_l2.run} file and change 
\begin{verbatim}
  run_mode       = FORWARD_MODEL
\end{verbatim}
to
\begin{verbatim}
  run_mode       = RETRIEVAL
\end{verbatim}

You can now run \texttt{oco\_l2.g95-1930} as you did before.  

\begin{verbatim}
  ${HOME}/alg/L2_EXE/trunk/bin/oco_l2.g95-1930 > stdout 2> stderr
\end{verbatim} %$

Although the calculation takes about 90 minutes on coral, the
retrieval easily succeeds, as we're starting from the exact state that
we used to generate the spectrum.  If you want to use a different
initial state, you will need to modify files in the \texttt{in}
directory.

\section{Input Files}

\subsection{The \texttt{in} directory}

The \texttt{in} directory contains sounding specific files, such as
the input spectrum, atmospheric state, instrument parameters, and so
on.  In this test case, the \texttt{in} directory contains three
subdirectories:

\begin{verbatim}
drwxr-xr-x  4 hnair algorithm 4096 Apr 25 15:33 l1b/
drwxr-xr-x  5 hnair algorithm 4096 Apr 25 15:33 scene/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 hnair algorithm   35 May  1 09:08 static -> ../../../../static_fts_locations/in/
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{in/l1b} contains information that will be extracted from
the HDF L1B output.  For a forward model spectrum simulation, details
of the viewing geometry must be present.

The \texttt{in/scene} directory contains atmospheric and surface
pressure profiles.  
 
The \texttt{in/static} directory contains databases of scattering
parameters, ground types, etc.  The specific file to use is specified
in the \texttt{oco\_l2.inp} file.

\subsection{The \texttt{oco\_l2.run} File}

The \texttt{oco\_l2.run} file contains parameters that are independent
of any individual scene.  It should not have to be updated very
often.  Please note that this name is hard-coded in the executable.
The code will look for this file in the current directory when it starts.

This file is mostly a list of keyword/value pairs.  The hash mark (\#)
is the comment marker.  Any characters following the hash mark will be
ignored.  Keywords are case insensitive, and except for paths and
filenames, values are also case insensitive.

An example is given in appendix D.2.

corresponding block here must include these parameters.

The radiances are binned on an optical depth vs. scattering grid.  The
optical depth coordinate ranges from -1 to 1 and is determined by:
\begin{align*}
  x &= \frac{2}{\pi}\tan^{-1}[S_1\tau_t(1-\frac{\tau_t}{\tau})] & (\tau < \tau_t)\\
    &= \frac{2}{\pi}\tan^{-1}[S_2(\tau-\tau_t)] & (\tau \ge \tau_t)
\end{align*}

Here $S_1$ is \texttt{stretch1}, $S_2$ is \texttt{stretch2}, and
$\tau_t$ is \texttt{tau\_thres}.  Figure~1 shows the effect of the
stretch on the functional form.  The bins are spaced evenly in
``metric'' space.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{tau2metric_new.ps}
\end{center}

\paragraph{\texttt{tau\_thres}}

The usage of \texttt{tau\_thres} is described above.  It should divide
``high'' and ``low'' optical depths.  A typical value is 0.1.

\paragraph{\texttt{stretch}}

The \texttt{stretch} keyword assigns values for \texttt{stretch1} and
\texttt{stretch2}.  The usage is described above.

\paragraph{\texttt{npoint}}

The \texttt{npoint} keyword assigns values for \texttt{npoint1} and
\texttt{npoint2}.  There are \texttt{npoint1} optical depth bins for
$\texttt{x} < \texttt{tau\_thres}$ and \texttt{npoint2} optical depth
bins for $\texttt{x} > \texttt{tau\_thres}$

\paragraph{\texttt{nscatter}}

The \texttt{nscatter} keyword specifies the number of scattering bins
to use.

\subsection{The Sounding Input File}

This file is specified in the run file using the input\_file keyword.
It contains two blocks: the SOUNDING\_INFO block and the
PARAMETER\_DEFINITION block.

\subsubsection{The SOUNDING\_INFO block}

\paragraph{\texttt{spectrum\_file}}

The \texttt{spectrum\_file} specifies the spectrum data for the retrieval.
This can refer either the the output of the forward model or an L1B HDF file.

\paragraph{\texttt{range\_file}}

The \texttt{range\_file} specifies which l1b files should be read.

\paragraph{\texttt{soundinginfo\_file}}

The \texttt{soundinginfo\_file} specifies the scene date and location.

\paragraph{\texttt{sounding\_number}}

The \texttt{sounding\_number} specifies the sounding within L1B and ECMWF HDF
  files that should be used. The index is 1-based, so if you use \texttt{hdfview} to
	view HDF files, remember that \texttt{hdfview} uses 0-based indicies. This means that
	if you want the data shown at index 4 via \texttt{hdfview}, you'll need to specify 5
	here.

\paragraph{\texttt{frame\_number}}

The \texttt{frame\_number} specifies the frame within L1B and ECMWF HDF
  files that should be used. The index is 1-based, so if you use \texttt{hdfview} to
	view HDF files, remember that \texttt{hdfview} uses 0-based indicies. This means that
	if you want the data shown at index 4 via \texttt{hdfview}, you'll need to specify 5
	here.

\subsubsection{The PARAMETER\_DEFINITION block}

This block contains blocks for each element in the state vector.  The
\texttt{aerosol\_types}, \texttt{albedo\_types}, and
\texttt{retrieval\_vector} keywords should be defined outside of the
sub-blocks.

Each of the blocks contained here may use the following keywords:

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{name}  &Name used for the column label in matrix files that are read in \\
\texttt{a\_priori} & Filename containing \textit{a priori\/} values.\\
\texttt{first\_guess}      & Filename containing first guess profiles.  If not present, \textit{a priori\/} values are used.\\
\texttt{covariance}      & Covariance matrix\\
\texttt{retrieval\_indices}      & list of retrieval indices, given as individual indices or a range.  1 2 3:11 12 is equivalent to 1:12, which means 1 through 12.\\
\texttt{perturb}      & Perturbations used for finite difference jacobians.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}


\paragraph{HDF Input Files}

\texttt{a\_priori} and \texttt{first\_guess} typically refert to matrix
	files.  However, they may refer to either an L1B or ECMWF HDF file for
	certain variables as described below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Block &Variable &HDF File type \\
\hline
GAS &H20 &ECMWF \\
SURFACE\_PRESSURE &PSURF &ECMWF \\
TEMPERATURE &T &ECMWF \\
INSTURMENT &DISP &L1B \\
INSTURMENT &ILS &L1B* \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

* Note that for the ILS, you must always have an ASCII .dat file because
certain variables not available in L1B HDF files are are read from the 
headers of the ASCII file. To specify an L1B file for the ILS, add a
'hdf\_file' header to the ASCII file that contains the path on an L1B
HDF file.

\paragraph{\texttt{aerosol\_types}}

The \texttt{aerosol\_types} lists the aerosol types (can be more than
one) to be used in this run.  Each name here must have a matching name
in an AEROSOL block later in the file.

\paragraph{\texttt{ground\_type}}

The \texttt{ground\_type} lists the ground type (only specify one) to
be used in this run.  Each name here must have a matching name in a
BRDF block later in the file.

\paragraph{\texttt{retrieval\_vector}}

The \texttt{retrieval\_vector} keyword lists the elements of the state
vector that are to be retrieved.  The \texttt{name} field of each
state vector element to be retrieved should be placed here.  For the
BRDF block, use the name for the whole BRDF block, and not the names
for the individual sub-blocks.

\paragraph{AEROSOL block}

The AEROSOL block contains the following keywords in addition to the
general ones specified above:

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{mie\_file}  & Mie scattering parameters \\
\texttt{moment\_file}  & Aerosol phase function moments\\
\texttt{retrieval\_mode}  & can be LINEAR or LOGARITHMIC\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{BRDF block}

A BRDF type can have spectrally dependent and independent parameters.
Each type is contained in either the SPECTRALLY\_DEPENDENT or
SPECTRALLY\_INDEPENDENT sub-blocks.  

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{type} & BRDF type - currently either lambert or coxmunk.
Specify this outside of the sub-blocks.\\
\texttt{num\_parameters}   & number of parameters used to fit the function\\
\texttt{num\_coefficients} & number of polynomial coefficients for
each parameter.  Only used in the spectrally dependent sub-block.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}


\paragraph{GAS block}
The GAS block contains the following keywords in addition to the general ones specified above:

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{hitran\_index} & HITRAN index of the gas - not used\\
\texttt{isotope}       & isotope label (e.g. 626 for O$^{16}$C$^{12}$O$^{16}$) - not used\\
\texttt{absco\_file}   & absorption coefficient file name\\
\texttt{scale\_parameters} & Four values: \textit{a priori}, initial guess, perturbation, covariance\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The \texttt{scale\_parameters} keyword is optional.  If present, a single scaling factor will be retrieved.  This scaling factor is multiplied by the profile to give the best fit.

\paragraph{INSTRUMENT block}

A separate INSTRUMENT block needs to be specified for each instrument parameter with the \texttt{type} keyword.

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{type} & CHANNELING, CONTINUUM, DISPERSION, GHOST, ILS, STRAY\_LIGHT, or ZERO\_LEVEL\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{SOLAR block}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{solar\_linelist} & list of solar lines, output from GFIT\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{SURFACE\_PRESSURE block}

The SURFACE\_PRESSURE block has no keywords specific to it.

\paragraph{TEMPERATURE block}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.75in}|}
\hline
\texttt{scale\_parameters} & Four values: \textit{a priori}, initial guess, perturbation, covariance\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As in the GAS block, the \texttt{scale\_parameters} keyword is optional.

\appendix

\section{SSH Tunneling}

The JPL firewall restricts access to most of the services on
nephthys.  External users can use SSH to connect, but the web and
subversion servers are not accessible.  SSH tunneling can be used to
``tunnel'' the web and subversion connections through SSH.

On the Colorado State system, I have created a file called
\texttt{config} in \texttt{/home/nair/.ssh} containing:

\begin{verbatim}
  Host nephthys
     ForwardX11   yes
     HostName     nephthys.jpl.nasa.gov
     LocalForward 20000 137.78.162.28:80
     LocalForward 20443 137.78.162.28:443
     ServerAliveInterval 600
     User         hnair
\end{verbatim}

This sets up ports on your local machine
(e.g. coral.atmos.colostate.edu) that are redirected to ports on
nephthys.  For example, the web server on nephthys is active on port
80.  The line

\begin{verbatim}
  LocalForward 20000 137.78.162.28:80
\end{verbatim}

redirects port 80 on IP address 137.78.162.28 (you can also use
127.0.0.1, since this is how a unix machine refers to itself) to port
20000 on coral.  The subversion server is active on port 443 on
nephthys.  This gets mapped to port 20443 on coral.

So to access the OCO Wiki, create an \texttt{\${HOME}/.ssh/config}
file like the one above (using your username, of course), and then
\texttt{ssh nephthys}.

Now if you open up a browser and point it to
\texttt{http://localhost:20000/$\sim$hnair/OCOWiki/}, you should see the
wiki page.

If you close the ssh connection to nephthys and try to reload the wiki
page, you will get an error.

To list the contents of the subversion repository:

\begin{verbatim}
  svn ls https://localhost:20443/oco/alg
\end{verbatim}

You should see:

\begin{verbatim}
  L2_Contrib/
  L2_EXE/
  L2_Support/
  L2_Tests/
\end{verbatim}

\section{Using \texttt{subversion}}

All of the OCO code, including that developed by the GDS, is managed
using \texttt{subversion}.  There are only a few commands you really
need to know:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Command & Short form & Description \\
\hline
\texttt{svn checkout} & \texttt{svn co} & Checkout a working copy\\
\texttt{svn update} & \texttt{svn up} & Update working copy\\
\hline
\texttt{svn diff} & \texttt{svn di} & Show differences between two versions\\
\texttt{svn list} & \texttt{svn ls} & List directory contents\\
\texttt{svn log} & \texttt{svn log} & Print commit log messages\\
\texttt{svn revert} & \texttt{svn revert} & Revert working copy to
original version\\
\texttt{svn status} & \texttt{svn st} & Print status of working copy\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Using \texttt{screen}}

\texttt{screen} is an enormously useful program that is included on
most modern Unix systems (including OS~X).  It creates a terminal
session that can be detached and reattached at any time.  What this
means is that you can set a job running inside of a screen session,
detach it and go home, and then reattach it from home to check on its
progress.

It is also very useful for setting up ssh tunnels.  On the Colorado
State computers, I ssh to nephthys using a screen session, and then
detach.  When I don't need the tunnel anymore, I reattach the screen
and log out.

\texttt{screen} creates a new screen. \texttt{screen -r} reattaches a
detached screen.  Basic commands within screen are:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Key sequence & Name & Description\\
\hline
\texttt{ctrl-a ''} & windowlist & Show the list of windows\\
\texttt{ctrl-a A} & title & Name this window\\
\texttt{ctrl-a c} & create & Create a new window\\
\texttt{ctrl-a d} & detach & Detach the session\\
\texttt{ctrl-a n} & next & Go to the next window \\
\texttt{ctrl-a p} & previous & Go to the previous window\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
