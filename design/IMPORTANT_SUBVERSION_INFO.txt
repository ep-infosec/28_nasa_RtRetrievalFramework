The design files in the directory *cannot* be merged by subversion if
multiple people work at the same time (e.g., A makes changes to r100, 
B makes changes to r100, A check in as r101, B tries to check in as
r102).

You need to use subversions locking mechanism. This is described in
detail at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.locking.html,
but the short instructions are:

1. Before working on a file do a lock, e.g,
   svn lock -m 'Locking to doblah blah' file.uml

2. Check in the file as normal when done "svn commit". This also removes
   the lock.

Note that if you want to commit a file to check point but continue working
on it, you need to lock it a second time after doing the commit. (or if you
want to be fancy, you can add "--no-unlock" to the commit command).

In certain cases, you may want to steal or break a lock (e.g., we need
to make a deliver, but user A is out sick and has a lock), you can
consult the subversion documentation on directions for this.
