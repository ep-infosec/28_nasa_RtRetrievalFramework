This data was imported to HDF using the short script "aerosol_to_hdf.rb".

Note that the ASCII data is in wavelength, but the HDF is in terms of 
wavenumber (the script converts this).

The phasefunction in the ASCII file used the Siewert convention (used by
VLIDORT), but for the HDF we convert this to de Rooij convention.

The ice_MODIS6.h5 file was supplied directly by Hannakaisa Lindqvist, no
ASCII files were used.
