This contains the boost portable stack trace function. This is not yet in boost,
but the code was made available in a post at http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2010/10/172303.php. Rather than writing out own implementation, we have
just copied the boost implementation here. This can go away if the boost
library ever adds this, or if a replacement is added.

We have included the supplied unit test in this directory. We don't actually
do anything with this, and it isn't even compiled. But it is a useful reference
to have.
