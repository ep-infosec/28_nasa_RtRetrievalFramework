This contains the Full Physics library.

For the C++ code, we divide into "Support", "Interface" and "Implementation".
The idea is that "Support" is the lowest level (e.g., FullPhysics::Exception 
class), "Interface" is mostly abstract classes and functions that work
with abstract classes, and "Implementation" is specific implementations
of the abstract classes.

If you are creating a new class, don't get too hung up on exactly where
it should go in the directory structure. All The code gets put into
one library, the divisions in directory are really just to organize the
source code files and give you some hint as to where to look for a
particular routine.  This is really just so we don't have one directory
with a hundred files in it,  the division between "Support",
"Interface" and "Implemenation" is pretty loose and in many cases somewhat
arbitrary.
