This code was formerly in support/python_lib. It has been moved here because:

1. It doesn't follow the PEP 8 python naming conventions
2. Doesn't have a unit test
3. Isn't used by anything in Level 2.

If any of this is actually needed, we can move this into the new
lib/Python directory, renaming and adding unit tests. But we won't bother
unless this actually is needed somewhere.
