Steps:

python ~/Level2/python_experimental/Bias/create_cov.py

ls -d 201206180* | sort | head -20 > sounding_list.txt
(Selects 20 soundings)

Create draws, and Level 1b going with that:
./create_draw_job_submit.sh
(On fullerene, submits a bunch of jobs to calculate this)

Do initial retrieval, to see which draws we can include
./do_retrieval_job_submit.sh

Get covariance from actual draws that made it through the retrieval
./create_draw_cov_job.sh

Do second retrieval:
./do_second_retrieval_job_submit.sh

Can start at the same time the bias calculation:
./bias_calc_job_submit.sh
